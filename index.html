  <h2>Resume for my application for the position of Director of Rumor Confirmation</h2>
  <p>
    Hi. My name is Kevin and I am an ideal fit for this job. As I understand, loose lips can sink ships, but not if there is a Director of Rumor Confirmations aboard. Personally, I have the skills to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Find rumors</li>
    <li>Confirm the rumors if true</li>
    <li>not deny the false rumors</li>
  </ul>
  <p>and it is my best skill to execute these in the proper order, which would be:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Find the rumor</li>
    <li>Observe the rumor's content</li>
    <li>proceede accordingly</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    As I understand, as the Director of Rumor Confirmation, it will be out of the scope of my job to confirm or deny false rumors, and that I should only refer the one who possesses the rumor to the Director of Rumor Denial. With these qualities, I believe I will be properly suited for this job.
  </p>
